# BSG Stroke Classifier

Welcome to the documentation for the **BSG Stroke Classifier**, a machine learning project designed to predict the likelihood of stroke events using patient medical records. This project focuses on the analysis, preprocessing, and modeling of healthcare data to build a reliable binary classifier.

---

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore a healthcare dataset and build an end-to-end classification pipeline for stroke prediction. It includes:

- **Data cleaning** and imputation of missing values.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand feature relationships.
- **Preprocessing**, including encoding and scaling.
- **Machine learning modeling** using classification algorithms.
- **Evaluation metrics** to assess performance.
- A clean and **reproducible structure** using Python, Poetry, and MkDocs.
